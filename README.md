# Loan Default Prediction Using Neural Networks

This project demonstrates how to predict loan default using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented in Python with TensorFlow and Keras.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `loan_default_prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `train.csv` – Training dataset.
- `test.csv` – Test dataset.
- `loan_predictions.csv` – Example of model prediction outputs.

## 🔧 Techniques Used

- Data preprocessing with Pandas and Scikit-learn
- Standardization of numerical features
- One-hot encoding of categorical features
- Dropout and L2 Regularization to reduce overfitting
- Early stopping to optimize training duration
- Model evaluation using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix

## 📊 Visualization

Training and validation loss over epochs were plotted to monitor learning progress.

## 🚀 How to Run
